# Platformer Game & Tic-Tac-Toe - README

## Platformer Game
This is a simple platformer game made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You control a character (who now looks like Mario) and jump across platforms while avoiding obstacles. The goal is to reach the finish line. There are three levels, each with coins to collect and hazards to dodge.

### Features:
- **Basic movement**: Move left, right, and jump.
- **Platforms & obstacles**: Jump on platforms, avoid red obstacles (they reset the game).
- **Coins**: Collect them to increase your score.
- **Levels**: Progress through three levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Finish line**: Reach the end to win.
- **Game over & restart**: Hit an obstacle? Game over! Press 'R' to restart.

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using JavaScript. Play against another player (no AI yet). The first to get three in a row wins!

### Features:
